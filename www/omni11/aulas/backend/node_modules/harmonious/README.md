# harmonious

Ensure that your Node.js CLI apps are loaded with the correct Node version based on `engines.node` in package.json, and with --harmony if needed.

## Usage

As simple as can be:

```js
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "=0.11.13"
  }
}
```

File **app.js**:
```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

var harmony = require('./harmonious');
harmony('./lib/cli');
```

**`harmonious`** will ensure that regardless of how you invoke your app,
`harmony` extensions will be loaded. These will all work:
```bash
$ ./app
$ node app
$ node --harmony app
$ n use 0.11.13 app
```

Say you have a global `bin` you want to use:
```json
{
  "bin": {
    "myapp": "app.js"
  }
}
```
You don't have to worry about trying to shove `--harmony` somewhere:
```
$ sudo myapp
$ sudo node myapp
```
